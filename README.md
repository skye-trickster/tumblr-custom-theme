# Blockout
 This is the first theme that I've ever written for Tumblr.

## Introduction
Hey guys. Looks like I finally finished making my first Tumblr theme! This was a huge undertaking and took me several weeks to actually get done. I’m still working on a README on my GitHub and and optimizations, but I think that it’s good enough that I can finally share it.

## Features:
- Mobile and desktop support
- Easy use to header image and profile
- Customizable navigation
- A toggle-able sidebar that slides in an out (desktop only) with the following:
    - An Updates Menu
    - Two sets of trending tags: a “guest tags” section and a “main tags” section

## Instructions:
- Please read the Terms of Use [here](#terms-of-use) before choosing to use this theme.
- Download the file “blockout.html” located within the “Theme” folder and copy the code (or just copy the HTML directly from the page)
- Go on your blog and click “Edit Appearance” (it may look like a paint palette) to go to your Customize menu
- Click “Custom theme”
- Paste the code into the “Edit HTML” box and press “Save”
- You will now have this theme to your heart’s content!

I’m still working hard to improve this theme as of now as it will be my main theme for hopefully a while. If you run into any bugs or issues, feel free to send in an ask. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful day.

## Terms of Use:

- Customize code for personal purposes only (do not hide the credit)
